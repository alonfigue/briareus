# Briareus / Tasks App
The name of this project was inspired by a Greek mythology's creature. As the app's purpose is to organize the tasks of a person, I wanted to use the name of a 
creature that has one hundred arms...

`'Briareus', also called Aegaeon, in Greek mythology, one of three 100-armed, 50-headed Hecatoncheires (from the Greek words for “hundred” and “hands”), the son of the 
deities Uranus (Heaven) and Gaea (Earth).`
