# Briareus / Tasks App
The name of this project was inspired by a Greek mythology's creature. As the app's purpose is to organize the tasks of a person, I wanted to use the name of a 
creature that has one hundred (100) arms...

*`"Briareus, also called Aegaeon, in Greek mythology, one of three 100-armed, 50-headed Hecatoncheires (from the Greek words for “hundred” and “hands”), the sons of the deities Uranus (Heaven) and Gaea (Earth). Homer (Iliad, Book I, line 396) says the gods called him Briareus; mortals called him Aegaeon (lines 403–404)."`*
